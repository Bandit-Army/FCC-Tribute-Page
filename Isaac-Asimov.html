       <h3>Here's an abridged timeline of Dr. Asimov's life:</h3>
       <ul>
        <li><b>October 4, 1919-January 2, 1920</b> Possible range of actual date of birth, actual date uncertain. Born in Petrovichi, Smolensk Oblast, Russia.
				<li><b>Winter, 1921</b> Isaac Asimov is one of 16 chlidren to catch double pnemonia, and the only one to survive.
				 <li><b>1923</b> Emigrated to the United States with his family at the age of 3.
				 <li><b>1928</b> Naturalized as a US citizen at the age of 8.
				 <li><b>March 1939</b> Young Isaac Asimov is published for the first time, having sold "Marooned off Vesta" to the magazine <em>Amazing Stories</em>.
				 <li><b>May 1939</b> Earned his BS in chemistry at the age of 18 from University Extension (later the Columbia University School of General Studies).
				 <li><b>1941</b> Coined the term "robotics" in the short story "Liar!". He later remarked that he thought at the time that he was using an already extant word.
				 <li><b>1947</b> Writes a spoof scientific paper as practice for his upcoming doctoral dissertation. His examiners effectively delivered their favorable verdict on his dissertation by good-naturedly asking him a final question about "thiotimoline". He had to be led from the room, as he was laughing hysterically in relief.
				 <li><b>1948</b> Earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree in biochemistry.
				 <li><b>1972</b> His novel <em>The Gods Themselves</em> wins that year's <em>Hugo</em>, <em>Nebula</em>, and <em>Locus</em> awards for Best Novel.
				 <li><b>1984</b> Named Humanist of the Year by the American Humanist Association (AHA). Served as honorary president of the AHA from 1985 until his death in 1992.
				 <li><b>December 1983</b> Undergoes a triple bypass surgery, during which he contracted HIV from a blood transfusion.
				 <li><b>April 6, 1992</b> Dies from kidney failure arising from complications related to AIDS.

					Most writers hate to write, and will grasp any excuse to do something else … There are exceptions. Isaac Asimov actually was never happier than sitting at a keyboard — first, his old typewriter; then, the TRS-80; and later, a more conventional PC. But then, Isaac was unusual, and his experience with writer's block was the worst 10 minutes of his life.<footer>Jerry Pournelle</footer>
